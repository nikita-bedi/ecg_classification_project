## Project Overview

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are among the most commonly performed diagnostic procedures in medicine, with over 10 million conducted annually in the United States. However, ECG interpretation remains challenging‚Äîeven for experienced clinicians. Studies have shown that manual interpretation accuracy hovers around **45‚Äì60% for non-cardiology healthcare professionals** and approximately **50% among physicians**.

This project aims to develop **automated, multilabel ECG classification models** that can predict multiple cardiac diagnoses from raw waveform data. Our work explores various deep learning architectures to identify the optimal approach for robust and generalizable ECG interpretation.

## Dataset

We used the **MIMIC-IV-ECG** dataset, available through PhysioNet. This is a large, real-world clinical dataset comprising:

- **800,000 ECGs from 160,000 patients**
- **90GB total size (33GB compressed)**


### üîç Dataset Components

1. **`record_df`**: Raw ECG waveform data (voltage-time signals from inpatient, outpatient, and emergency settings).
2. **`measure_df`**: Machine-generated ECG measurements (e.g., RR interval, QTc).
3. **`outcomes_df`**: Diagnostic labels and outcomes, including ICD-10 codes and mortality data.

**Note** Due to data use regulations, the raw data for this project cannot be shared publicly. You can request access to the MIMIC-IV-ECG dataset via PhysioNet by completing the required data use agreements and credentialing.

## Models

We experimented with a variety of deep learning models to evaluate performance across several metrics, including AUC, AUPRC, and balanced accuracy.

### Architectures

- **Vanilla CNN**
- **Autoencoder + MLP Classifier**
- **CNN-LSTM Hybrid**
- **ResNet1D**
- **Transformer Classifier**
- **Transformer-CNN Hybrid**

## Results & Insights

**ResNet1D** delivered the strongest overall performance, offering a strong balance of generalization and robustness. Its residual connections improved training stability and allowed the model to capture both local waveform features and global contextual information across ECG sequences.

While **CNN-LSTM** performed well on classes with temporal patterns (e.g., **Premature Atrial Complex - PAC**), **ResNet1D** consistently outperformed on the majority of diagnoses.

Transformer-based models **underperformed**, and the hybrid model‚Äîwhile better‚Äîstill lagged behind the simpler residual architecture.

## Conclusion

For multilabel ECG diagnosis on an imbalanced, real-world dataset, **ResNet1D** provided the most reliable performance and is our recommended architecture.

This project was completed as part of **AC209B at Harvard University**.
